Procedural Textures
Diana Southard
CSCI 5239 Spring 2016

#### Directions
Create a program that allows a scene to be viewed in 3D from any direction
under user control.

The objects in the scene should be colored using a procedural texture shader.
You may not use the brick or mandlebrot shaders shown in class.  If you use a
shader from the text or the web, you should improve it.

Your scene should be lit.  You may reuse the phong() function from Example 3
but improvements are always encouraged.

The resulting shader may be only a few lines long, so make sure you can justify
and explain every line.

#### Program Use Instructions


**Time To Complete Assignment:** ~ 7 hours

Based on provided class Example 3.
